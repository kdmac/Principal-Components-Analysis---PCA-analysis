# Principal-Components-Analysis---PCA-analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation which converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables. PCA is a most widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in machine learning for predictive models. Moreover, PCA is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. It is also known as a general factor analysis where regression determines a line of best fit.a principal component can be defined as a linear combination of optimally-weighted observed variables. The output of PCA are these principal components, the number of which is less than or equal to the number of original variables. Less, in case when we wish to discard or reduce the dimensions in our dataset. The PCs possess some useful properties which are listed below:  The PCs are essentially the linear combinations of the original variables, the weights vector in this combination is actually the eigenvector found which in turn satisfies the principle of least squares. The PCs are orthogonal, as already discussed. The variation present in the PCs decrease as we move from the 1st PC to the last one, hence the importance.
